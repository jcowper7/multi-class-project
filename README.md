# multi-class-project
CSC8365 ML Extended project

The aim of this project is to use open data, in this case Amazon pet product reviews as a proxy client data, to develop a mulit-class classiication model to identify classes based on free-text (reviews).

This project will first pre-process text and develop features, then following exploratory analysis, determine the best predictor from a suite of models.
